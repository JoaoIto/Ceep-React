# [Ceep ( React JS ðŸ’™)](https://joaoito.github.io/Ceep-React/)

**React is a JavaScript language library and one of the most modern ways to create web applications. It works in a declarative, efficient and flexible way, enabling the creation of complex interactions. It has a syntax, a superset of JS, known as JSX.**

**In applications that have been in development for a longer time, you may find React projects based on classes, so it is very important that you know the Object Orientation paradigm**

**This paradigm helps us organize our code, facilitating its maintenance and readability, which is very important within a team, regardless of the size of the project.**

In the page we made, we used the framwork to show a ceep, the design is still minimalist, but we used the updated JavaScript and HTML resources and soon we will be adding the step-by-step documentation of the project! ;)

## **How to start a project in React?**

- Inside your file that you want to turn into a React app, open the terminal in the folder and start it in the terminal with the command:

``npx create-react-app <AppName>``

- Once created, see if it checks the entire installation and if the files are already listed... And if it does, navigate to the project folder, then start with npm. Commands:

``cd <folderName>``
