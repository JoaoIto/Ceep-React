**The note list is the component that will work together with the note card itself, which will make the points of interest of each note, such as a study card, a work card, or whatever.**


**In addition to the HTML structure, it also takes a logical structure in JS that makes the note index function, for each note's point of interest, passed by the map() method. In the function we still use a React function which is the key! It uses the defined parameter to place what is to be used inside the HTML framework.**
