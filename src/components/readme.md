# Why use HTML components and not just do it together and manage in different folders? ðŸ¥µ

**Components in React are used separately since to have a control and yet a joint interaction in just one render file. We can cite this as an example the components in the files above!**

**They make the HTML code together with the HTML behaviors, and so we only need a default parent file, which is normally done by App.JS, and so we render this entire component in the graphical interface!**
